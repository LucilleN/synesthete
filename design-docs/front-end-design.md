# Front End Design and White Paper: **Synesthete**

## Application Description
**Synesthete** is a React web app that will allow users to visualize what music sounds like to people with _chromesthesia_, or sound-to-color synesthesia. Chromesthetes naturally associate colors with sounds, making listening to music a vibrant experience; Synesthete aims to let others experience it as well by displaying animated sound bars corresponding to the colors of the notes throughout the song. Users will be able to search for songs either by title or by album in order to select a song they would like to see visualized. Then, Synesthete will display a clip of that song with animated visualization. After watching and listening to a clip of one song, users will have the option to view another song that may be visually similar, return to their previous search results, or search for another song.<br/>

Synesthete utilizes the Spotify Web API, but its main purpose is not the same as Spotify's; rather than providing a platform for music streaming, this web app instead seeks to create an experience of music from a different angle, specifically through the lens of chromesthesia. Thus, Synesthete's front-end design does _not_ aim to improve upon the usability of existing music streaming platforms like Spotify itself. Instead, its purpose is to educate users about synesthesia and guide them towards their end goal, the visualization of a song. Thus, the priority of Synesthete's design is to be as simple and learnable as possible so that users can easily experience a phenomenon that they lack preexisting knowledge of.<br/>

In the process of designing Synesthete, I tried to forecast what errors users might make and how Synesthete's front-end design could best work with users' expectations and preexisting knowledge. For example, users might not notice that they have the wrong search category selected, or they might be confused when a visualization takes a long time to load. Usability issues might also arise from the limitations of the Spotify Web API; a user might want to choose a lesser-known song, but if it does not exist in the Spotify database, it will not appear in Synesthete's search results. In addition, since Synesthete relies heavily on color to provide a satisfying user experience, it runs the risk of becoming inaccessible to users with colorblindness or other visual impairments. Most importantly, users who lack knowledge about synesthesia or music in general could quickly get overwhelmed or confused. To address these potential usability issues, I focused on design decisions that would effectively convey my mental model and minimize user errors by prioritizing simplicity, structure, clarity, feedback, and consistency.<br/>

### Web Service Used
Synesthete will use the Spotify Web API to find tracks and obtain information about them to programmatically create each one's unique visualization. Spotify is a popular audio streaming platform that offers users over 50 million tracks; the Spotify Web API allows developers to access information about tracks, albums, artists, and genres that are stored in the Spotify Data Catalogue. (It also provides access to user information, but Synesthete will not be using that function of the API.) Synesthete will use the Spotify Web API to: (1) search for a song by title or album, (2) get detailed analytical information on a particular song's audio features, and (3) suggest another song that shares audio attributes and might thus be visually similar. Specifically, Synesthete will use the following endpoints:

0. **API Token (Authentication):** Before any of these API calls can be made, Spotify requires developers to obtain an access token that all the other endpoints require for authorization. Synesthete follows Spotify's Client Credentials Flow for server-to-server authentication, since the app is only concerned about song information and does not access any user data. Thus, the first request we need to make is to the `/api/token` endpoint (`POST https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token`). This request requires an encoded string containing the developer's client ID and secret key, and returns an access token that expires within a few minutes. We need this token for all future API calls, so Synesthete will have to continuously refresh the access token whenever a new API call must be made. ([See the documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#client-credentials-flow))

1. **Search:** In order to allow users to search up songs, Synesthete uses Spotify's `/v1/search` endpoint (`GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/search`). This endpoint requires the client's access token (from step 0), an item type to search for (either album, artist, playlist, or track), a query, and (optionally) the maximum number of results. Synesthete will implement search for only albums or tracks, and will use the default maximum number of results, 20. The API then returns a JSON object containing an array of either track objects or album objects (which each also contain an array of track objects). In either scenario, Synesthete will receive track objects from which we can extract the title, ID, artist name(s), album name, and preview link for each song. This information will constitute the search results; Synesthete will display up to 20 tracks from a search. Each search result will display the track title, artist, and album, while internally storing the track's unique ID and the URL for its 30-second MP3 preview. ([See the documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/search/search/))

2. **Get Audio Features:** When a song has been selected for visualization (either by a user clicking on a search result, or by getting a visually similar song from Spotify Web API's recommendation), we then need to get the audio features for that track by using the `/v1/audio-features/{id}` endpoint (`GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-features/{id}`). This endpoint requires the access token (from step 0) and a unique track ID (from step 1 or step 3), and it returns an audio features object. The audio features object contains song properties like key, time signature, acousticness, energy, instrumentalness, valence, and tempo, just to name a few. Synesthete will store the values for each of these properties, and in conjunction with the MP3 of the song's preview, will generate an animated visualization with colors that reflect the music. ([See the documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/))

3. **Get Recommendations:** Once a particular song's visualization has been displayed, Synesthete offers users the option to get a visually similar song, and in order to do so, we utilize Spotify Web API's `/v1/recommendations` endpoint (`GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/recommendations`). This API function generates track recommendations based on the provided seeds of information. It requires the access token (from step 0), and then accepts a wide range of other parameters. Synesthete will use the current visualized song's title and artist as a `seed_artist` and `seed_track`, and will also use the current track's audio feature properties to set targets for the recommended tracks' properties. For example, if the current song has a valence value of 0.89, we would set the recommendation's `target_valence` parameter to 0.89. We will also set the maximum number of results to be 1. In response, the API will return an array of track objects that best meet the parameters; in Synesthete's case, the single element of the array would be the next visualized song. ([See the documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/browse/get-recommendations/))<br/>

## Top-Level Design/Layout
The Synesthete web app will consist of three main pages: a home page, a search page, and a visualization page. In general, the entire app uses a dark background with lighter, contrasting text. The color scheme simply consists of three colors: dark purple, salmon pink, and white. The font is consistent for all text, from the headings to the paragraphs to the buttons. Elements that deserve the most attention, such as the search button, have higher contrast against the background, and anything that is clickable should highlight and become brighter/bolder when it is hovered over. (See Image 2 for an example of this.)<br/>

At the top of each page is a wide menu bar that contains the application name, "Synesthete," in the top left corner, as well as two buttons: "home" and "search." If the user is currently on one of those two pages, its corresponding menu button text will turn from pink to white. The top menu would persist at the top of the screen on every page. The only page that involves long lists is the search results (see image 4), but its scroll bar only scrolls through an element contained inside the page, not the entire document. If any other page were to require a scroll bar, the top menu should become sticky; overall, it would never be out of sight. Finally, any page that requires noticeable loading time (such as for search results or visualization) should display a typical loading spinner with an informative message underneath (see Image 7 for an example of this).<br/>

**Image 1: Home Page**
![home page](/images/mockups/synesthete-home.svg)
The home page is where users begin. The page itself consists of four main parts; at the top, under the menu, is the heading "Synesthete" in large, white, highly-contrasting letters, as well as the subtitle "hear in color" in pink, slightly less contrasting. Underneath is a section explaining in plain English what synesthesia and chromesthesia are as real-world neurological phenomena, as well as what Synesthete aims to do for all users. The third section is a 3-point list indicating to users the steps that they will be taking: first searching for a song or album, then choosing a song, then watching and listening to its visualization. Lastly, at the bottom of the page is a big, bold purple button labeled "start."<br/>

**Image 2: Home Page with hovered-over button**
![home page with button hover](/images/mockups/synesthete-home-hover.svg)
This image shows how buttons throughout the site should highlight when they are hovered over.<br/>

**Image 3: Search page**
![search page](/images/mockups/synesthete-search.svg)
The search page is where users are taken when they click on the "start" button from the home page, or when they click on "search" in the top menu. This page contains the heading "search for a song" in bright pink, then a labelled "search by" drop-down menu that allows users to change the category they want to search through (either title or album). Below the drop-down menu, in the very center of the page, is a search field with a magnifying glass icon on the left side and placeholder text in the middle. The translucent placeholder text in the search field should update based on what category is selected in the dropdown; e.g. if the user had selected to search by album, the placeholder text would say "search song albums." Underneath the search field in small, transparent letters, there is the hint: "press enter to search." In addition, at the bottom of the page, there is another big, bold purple button labelled "search." When a user starts typing in the search field, the placeholder text would disappear and a cancel button would appear on the right side of the input field.<br/>

**Image 4: Search Results**
![search results](/images/mockups/synesthete-search-results.svg)
Once a search has been submitted, the Search page would update so that the heading, drop-down menu, input field, and search button are all slightly smaller and arranged horizontally at the top of the page. Below that, the page would display the number of results received from the Spotify search API. It is followed by a sentence instructing users to select one of the songs below. In smaller, fainter text just below that line, a hint reads: "Didn't find what you were looking for? Try searching again and check that you are searching the right category." Below the text is the list of search results (maximum 20) in a scrollable div. Each result displays the title, artist, and album of a song, and the results are arranged in rows of slightly different, alternating shades of pink. Each row is clickable anywhere on the entire rectangle, and the entire row should highlight (as shown) when hovered over. Clicking on a result should take a user to the Visualization page (see Image 6). Alternatively, if the user wants to search again, they can do so directly at the top of the page.<br/>

**Image 5: Search Yielded No Results**
![search results failure](/images/mockups/synesthete-search-results-fail.svg)
If the search were to yield no results, the top of the search page would stay the same as above; there would still be the heading, search field, dropdown menu, and button arranged horizontally at the top, and the number of results would still be reported right underneath. However, instead of the instructions, it displays an apology, explaining that the search yielded no results. Then, it displays a faint frowning face and two messages. The first message explains why the search yielded no songs: the track or album the user searched for does not exist in the database. The second message suggests the user to make sure they are searching in the correct category or to try a new search query.<br/>

**Image 6: Visualization Page**
![visualization](/images/mockups/synesthete-visualization.svg)
On this page, the user will be able to visualize a 30-second clip of the selected song. The majority of the page is taken up by a dark purple canvas that renders colored, animated sound bars corresponding to the notes of the song. When the page first opens, the animation/audio should load first if needed, and would show a spinning  and then immediately start playing on its own. Below the animation is a video progress bar with a play/pause button on the left and the time elapsed/total time on the right. Above animation canvas extends is a slightly lighter purple rectangle that holds the song information: the song's title, artist, and album are displayed on the left, and extra details about the song (such as its key, valence, acousticness, etc.) are displayed on the right. At the top of the page, below the menu, are three buttons showing users three options for next steps. On the top left is a button that leads back to the user's last search results. On the right is a button that leads to a new search (which does the same as clicking on "search" in the top menu). The middle button, which is brighter pink than the other two, gives users the option to get a visually similar song. If the user selects the middle button, the Visualization page should immediately reload and show the visualization of the new recommended song.<br/>

**Image 7: Loading Pages - Search Results**
![search-loading](/images/mockups/synesthete-search-loading.svg)
If a page takes more than 1 second to load, the page will display a spinner and an informational message. This image shows what the Search page would look like after a user has submitted a search query, before the search results are displayed. When loading, the line that usually indicates the number of search results would have two dashes instead of a number. There is a rotating spinner in the center of the page, in the container that will eventually be populated with the search results. Below it, a message reads, "hold on while we find songs for you."

**Image 8: Loading Pages - Visualization Page**
![visualization-loading](/images/mockups/synesthete-visualization-loading.svg)
This image shows what the Visualization page would look like while loading. Like the Search page, there would be a rotating spinner and an informational message in the container that will eventually display the animated colored bars. In addition, below the informational message, there is a tip that reads, "make sure your volume is on!"<br/>

## Usage Scenarios
Users of Synesthete would either come to the web app out of curiosity, not knowing what synesthesia or chromesthesia are; or, they would come with the purpose of experiencing what a song looks like or finding what other songs look similar. In either scenario, there are two concrete tasks that a user would be able to accomplish: visualizing a particular song, and finding a visually similar song; the first task is a stepping stone to the second.<br/>

Note: User interface elements that a user would interact with in the following usage cases are _italicized_.

### Visualizing A Particular Song - New User
For a new user to perform the task of visualizing a particular song, they will need to use _all three pages_ of the web app (and the buttons and input fields within them): the Home page, the Search page/Search results, and the Visualization page.

1. All users begin on the _home page_. A new user with neither domain knowledge nor interface knowledge would first need to read through the _informational blurb_ on the home page to learn what synesthesia is and what Synesthete does, and then read the three-point set of simple _instructions_. (The user would still be able to navigate through the site perfectly well if they did not read, but without background knowledge, they would not know what they are trying to do and why.) The user would then click on the _"start" button_ at the bottom of the page, and the site will redirect them to the search page. (Screenshots below: Home page; Home page with "start" button hovered over.)
![homepage](/images/mockups/synesthete-home.svg)
![homepage hover](/images/mockups/synesthete-home-hover.svg)

2. On the _search page_, the user would use the _"search by" dropdown menu_ to select a category, and then would type into the _search field_ some song or album that they know. Then they would either _hit enter_ or click on the _"search" button_ below. The page would spend a moment loading if needed, displaying a _spinner_ and a _loading message_ like "hold on while we find songs for you." (Screenshots below: Search page; Search page with text typed into the search field; Search page loading results.)
![search page](/images/mockups/synesthete-search.svg)
![search page typing](/images/mockups/synesthete-search-type.svg)
![search page loading](/images/mockups/synesthete-search-loading.svg)

3. Then, once the search results have been loaded and are displayed, the user would scroll through the _list of results_, identify a song they want to visualize by its _displayed title, artist, and album_, and then click anywhere on the _rectangular row_ to select it. If the search yielded no results, they would type a different query into the _search field_ or change the category in the _drop-down menu_ and try again. (Screenshots below: Search page with results; Search page with no results.)
![search page results](/images/mockups/synesthete-search-results.svg)
![search page fail](/images/mockups/synesthete-search-results-fail.svg)

4. The user would finally be taken to the visualization page. The page should take a moment to load, displaying a _spinner_ and a _message_ like "hold on while we create your song's visualization," and another _message_ that says "Make sure your audio is on!" Once the page loads, the _audio sample and its animation_ will begin playing on its own, and the user can watch and listen to the visualized song. The user would be free to use the _pause/play_ button to the left of the progress bar and the _slider handle_ on the progress bar itself to stop and start the visualization or jump to different parts of a song as they wish. (Screenshots below: Visualization page loading; Visualization page.)

![visualization page](/images/mockups/synesthete-visualization.svg)

### Visualizing A Particular Song - Experienced User
An experienced user coming to the web app with a song they know they want to visualize would go through roughly the same process, but they would be able to use the _top menu_ to navigate faster. Instead of reading through the home page and clicking the start button at the bottom of the page (which may require them to first scroll down, depending on their screen size), they can simply click on the _search button_ in the top menu. This would direct the user to the _search page_, and the user would continue as described above. (They would choose the appropriate category in the _drop-down menu_, type into the _search field_, _hit enter_ or press the _search button_ to search, scroll through the _results_, and click on one of the _rows_. Likewise, they would also be taken to the _visualization page_ to watch and listen to the _animation/audio_.) (Screenshots below: Menu bar with search button.)
![menu bar](/images/mockups/menu-bar.png)

### Finding and Visualizing a Visually Similar Song: Either New or Experienced User
For any user to find a visually similar song, they first must take _all the previously described steps_ to identify the original song they want to visualize. From the _visualization page_, the user can click on the _"get a visually similar song" button_ at the center of the top of the page. The visualization page with then reload, displaying the _spinner_ and _loading message_ once again. The page will then display the _visualization for the new song_, which would start playing immediately after loading. The user is free to repeat this step as many times as they like, clicking the _"get a visually similar song" button_ each time they want a new recommendation. At any time, the user can press the _pause/play button_ on the left side of the _video progress bar_ to pause and resume the animation. (Screenshots below: "get a visually similar song" button.)

## Design Rationale
As the developer/designer of Synesthete and as someone with synesthesia myself, my ultimate goal for this web app is to help users get a taste of the experience of color in music, learn from it, and enjoy it. This means that, while I have a clear concept of what synesthesia is and how this web app utilizes it, I have to effectively convey my _mental model_ of synesthesia and the Synesthete web app to the users. [1]<br/>

Several usability researchers, including Jakob Nielsen, advocate that one of the most basic, foundational principles of usability design is to _know the user_ [2], and in fact, one of Nielsen's ten usability heuristics is to "speak the user's language." [3] I expect almost all users to lack both domain knowledge and interface knowledge. Most people do not know what synesthesia is, and few people have it themselves; in addition, none of the initial users would have used the Synesthete web app before. Thus, I designed the web app with the assumption that almost all users will be novices. As a result, my first priority was to make the app as learnable and easy to use as possible. One of Bruce Tognazzini's First Principles of Interaction Design is to "provide deep ruts," or to provide a lot of guidance for inexperienced users. [4] I applied this principle by creating a home page where the very first thing users see is a brief, plain-English explanation of synesthesia and the whole point of the Synesthete app. Then, the three simple steps that users will have to carry out to accomplish their task (visualizing a song) are laid out clearly.<br/>

In order to make Synesthete as clear and learnable as possible without overwhelming or confusing new users, I made the web app's overall design simple and minimalistic. According to Nielsen, "User interfaces should be simplified as much as possible, since every additional feature or item of information on a screen is one more thing to learn, one more thing to possibly misunderstand, and one more thing to search through when looking for the thing you want." [5] He encourages minimizing a user's navigation through the site. Thus, Synesthete consists of only three main pages, all of which are minimalistic. Each page has only a few things that are clickable, and all clickable items are large and labelled; they follow Fitts's Law, which roughly states that it takes less time to hit targets that are closer and larger -- in other words, bigger buttons are easier to click. [4] An example of this is the Search results; each result is clickable anywhere in its row, making it a very large, rectangular button that is easy to click.<br/>

In addition, to support internal locus of control, users should always be informed of what they are doing and what the application is doing [6]. With Synesthete, this is important given that users probably lack domain and interface knowledge. Thus, throughout Synesthete's three-step process, buttons are labelled clearly, and simple instructions are listed to remind users of where they are in the process and what their end goal is. For example, the instructions above the search results tell the user to "select a song from the results below to see and hear its visualization." In addition, one of Nielsen's ten heuristics is clearly-marked exits [7], and the Neilsen Norman Group specifically lists the guideline of having a one-click link to the homepage to provide users with a sense of home base. [8] The menu's home button and the logo in the top left both serve this purpose. Furthermore, the sticky menu bar that persists at the top of each page gives users a sense of safety since it serves as a stable perceptual cue that is visible even if you have to scroll down.<br/>

Another aspect of supporting the user's perception of control is to give informative and effective feedback. Feedback is a concept that almost all interaction design gurus agree is important, including Tognazzini [4] and Nielsen [9]. This is especially important when a user might be faced with delays, and since Synesthete uses a web service API, it is likely that some things will take time to load, such as search results or MP3 files. According to the Nielsen Norman Group, any delay more than 1 second long makes users feel impatient and "at the mercy of the computer." [10] Thus, Synesthete gathers a maximum of 20 search results at a time to avoid spending an inordinate amount of time loading results. In addition, Synesthete provides informative feedback in loading messages. This would help users feel in control and informed of the situation, rather than confused and in the dark.<br/>

The loading messages as well as other interface components in Synesthete also try to prevent user errors, which is a principle that both Ben Shneiderman and Neilsen advocate. [6,11] The message that appears while the visualization is loading prompts users to check that their volume is on so that users do not start watching the visualization and wonder what they are looking at since they cannot hear the accompanying audio. In addition, the placeholder text in the search fields updates based on the search category selected in order to prevent users from accidentally searching in the wrong category. If they do make errors, however, Nielsen says that a good error message would help a user understand the application better. [12] Thus, if a search turns up no results, the messages on the screen prompt users to check that they are searching in the right category, leading users to understand that the system expects them to search by song title or by album.<br/>

In addition, the design of the Synesthete app strives for consistency. Consistency is important because, according to Nielsen, "If users know that the same command or the same action will always have the same effect, they will feel more confident in using the system, and they will be encouraged to try out exploratory learning strategies because they will already have part of the knowledge needed to operate new parts of the system." [13] Thus, in Synesthete, many of the icons and symbols are commonly used in other apps, and most users would already understand their meaning. The magnifying glass icon in the search field indicates that users can type in something to search for, and most users also understand that they can click on the button with a cross through it to cancel their search. In addition, I focused on using consistency within the web app itself to prevent distractions and confusion. Each page uses the same simple color scheme and fonts throughout, and anything that is clickable (like the start button or the rows of the search results) highlights in the same way, giving users consistent feedback about what they can interact with.<br/>

Since Synesthete is, by nature, a very color-centered app, it will most likely not be as enjoyable for people who are colorblind. However, according to Nielsen, about 8% of males are colorblind, so any app should "make it possible to interpret the screens even without being able to differentiate the colors." [14] To address this accessibility issue, I tested screenshots of the home page with several different colorblindness filters (shown below) and ensured that someone with vision impairments would still be able to navigate the site. [15] In my design, I did not use any color-coded buttons, and everything clickable is labelled. In addition, important text and page elements have higher color contrast so that they are easy to see even in monochrome.<br/>

<img src="/images/colorblindTests/blue-blind-tritanopia.png" height="150">
<br/>

Despite these accessibility considerations, I still deliberately used bold colors (deep purple, salmon pink, and bright white), especially because the app itself is about a vibrant and colorful experience of music. In Google's Material Design, one of their primary principles is to "use bold typography, space, scale, color to create hierarchy, meaning and focus that immerse viewers in the experience." [16] I ultimately want Synesthete to be an immersive experience that involves multiple senses, both sight and sound.<br/>

Finally, although efficiency is not a priority goal for Synesthete's design, there are a few shortcuts available for users that return to this web app repeatedly to visualize more songs. Shortcuts should promote efficiency by making experienced users' navigation of a site take less time. [17] Thus, instead of having to scan past the blurbs and instructions on the home page to look for the "start" button, returning users can simply click the "search" button in the top menu and go directly to the search page. Standard keyboard shortcuts, such as pressing enter to submit a search, also apply.<br/>

In conclusion, Synesthete's front-end design aims to provide an easy, simple, and enjoyable experience for users learning about something they have not seen or done before. Thus, I focused on making the site simple and minimalistic, with a clear, guided process and with consistent, easily-interpretable elements that will help minimize user errors/confusion. In doing so, I hope to convey my mental model of Synesthete, a tool that allows users to get a taste of synesthesia, to the users themselves.<br/>

## Usability Metric Forecast
Overall, of the five usability metrics, I expect this web app to be strongest at learnability and weakest at efficiency. The following forecasts are listed in order of decreasing strength of the metric.

1. **Learnability:** My first priority in designing Synesthete was to make it as simple and easy as possible for users to learn, specifically because I expect most users to lack domain and interface knowledge since synesthesia is such a rare phenomenon. I focused on implementing principles like providing structured guidance and feedback to inexperienced users, reducing distractions in favor of simplicity and minimalism, and clearly labelling items/offering messages that allow the user to always know what step of the process they are at. Ultimately, the structure of the Synesthete web app involves only three pages, and users can move from page to page in a simple progression of steps. Once this is implemented, I expect that a completely novice user, with no experience with the Synesthete web app or knowledge of synesthesia in general, would still be able to learn how to use the app and navigate Synesthete with confidence.

2. **Few Errors:** Throughout the front-end design, I tried to make the purpose of each element as clear as possible and to keep users informed at every step in order to prevent them from making errors. For example, the default text in the search bar updates based on what category the user has chosen to search in. The web app displays feedback when information takes a long time to load or when a search query returns no results, allowing users to feel in control and informed. In addition, almost all clickable items are labelled (such as the search button) or consistent with other applications (such as the pause/play button on the Visualization page and the magnifying glass icon in the search bar). Thus, from the big-picture process down to the purpose of each button, I tried to make the design as clear as possible to minimize users' mistakes. However, I cannot have thought of every edge case, and I expect that users will still make errors, and there is bound to be some confusion.

3. **Subjective Satisfaction:** I ultimately want Synesthete to provide an immersive and enjoyable, stress-free experience, since its purpose is to give users a taste of a fun, colorful phenomenon. My hope is that the app will be very subjectively satisfying to users, but since synesthesia is such a foreign concept to most people, I am not entirely sure what expectations users might have. It is possible that my focus on learnability through simplicity and structure results in too much hand-holding and restriction, or that users want to be able to do more than just see colorful moving bars. Thus, while I hope that users find it fun and satisfying, I think the strength of this metric will have to be investigated with testing and surveys.

4. **Memorability:** Memorability was not a very high priority for Synesthete. There are only three sequential steps and three main pages, so it should not be difficult for users to remember how to use the app, but since I focused on keeping the user informed and spelling out exactly how the app should be used, users would not really _need_ to remember how to use it in the first place. Overall, I did not put much effort into making the web app particularly memorable.

5. **Efficiency:** Finally, I think my site would be very weak at efficiency. Efficiency was a low priority for my design; I only included one real button shortcut to jump immediately to the search page, but this shortcut does not reduce the overall time it takes to navigate the site by very much, and ultimately the number of clicks the user has to make is the same. Because I prioritized creating a simple, constrained process, efficiency was a major tradeoff. If an experienced user wanted to find a lot of visually similar songs at once, for example, it would take a long time, and they would have to visualize each song one by one. However, I ultimately decided that simplicity is more important than efficiency for this particular web app because most users probably have no domain knowledge or interface knowledge. Thus, this design sacrifices speed for ease of use -- learnability at the cost of efficiency.
